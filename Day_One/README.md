## 🚀 **[50-Day Challenge] Mastering 230 Python DSA Problems**

### 🎯 **Challenge Commitment: Raising the Bar**

This repository serves as a testament to my focused commitment to significantly elevate my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) proficiency. I have challenged myself to solve **230 diverse Python programming problems** sourced from GeeksforGeeks over **50 consecutive days**.

This rigorous schedule is designed to demonstrate my ability to learn rapidly, implement optimized solutions under pressure, and maintain a high standard of code quality—qualities essential for any senior engineering role.

| Metric | Target | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duration** | 50 Days | ⏳ In Progress |
| **Total Problems** | 230 Problems | 📈 Tracking progress... |
| **Commitment** | Daily Submissions | ✅ Consistent |

### 🛠️ **Ability & Focus Areas**

My solutions emphasize practical application and production-ready code. Hiring managers can gauge my capabilities in the following key areas by reviewing the code within this repository:

| Core Skill Demonstrated | Key Focus in Solutions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time/Space Optimization** | Consistent use of Hash Maps, Two Pointers, and Dynamic Programming to achieve $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$ complexity. |
| **Code Readability & Maintainability** | Usage of Pythonic idioms, type hinting (`typing` module), and clean variable naming. |
| **Debugging & Edge Cases** | Robust handling of constraints, empty inputs, and boundary conditions (e.g., maximum integer values). |
| **Fundamental DSA** | Expert implementation of Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, and Graph traversals (BFS/DFS). |

### 📂 **Repository Structure & Navigation**

The solutions are meticulously organized by the primary data structure or algorithmic technique used, ensuring clarity and ease of review.

### 📈 **Performance & Tracking**

A dedicated **`PROGRESS_LOG.md`** file (within this repo) details the daily breakdown of problems solved, the corresponding GeeksforGeeks links, and my personal time/complexity analysis for challenging solutions.

> **Excerpt from `PROGRESS_LOG.md`:**
>
>   * **Day 1:** Solved 5 problems. Focus: Array rotations and prefix sums.
>   * **Day 10:** Achieved 50 problems solved. Key Takeaway: Mastered **Sliding Window** technique implementation.
>   * *(Review `PROGRESS_LOG.md` for full details)*
